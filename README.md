Project Archive Tool for Caido Workspaces

## I don't like deleting things.
I just don't. If I have the disk space and a good place to put something, I'll store it away for an unreasonable duration. Every once it a while it's interesting to revisit something ~~ancient~~ timeless, like the coursework I kept from an old embedded programming course or Debian 3.1r0 netinstall ISOs.

## I'd rather not have a continuously growing catch-all bucket.
Caido offers non-paid users two project slots. Initially my habitual behavior ended up with me having one project named "other" and one reasonably titled with whatever I was working on at the time, deleting once I was moving on to something else.

## These two points are at odds.
So I tossed together a tool that dumps some metadata and tgz's up a project. I'm doubting how much I'll be using the "restore" feature, but it's a tidy package I can keep locally, push to a NAS, and sync to a cloud for $6/TB/mo for that odd chance I need it again.
